    <h2>Air Fried Chicken Tender Recipe</h2>
        <p>Simple, basic air fryer chicken tenders that are crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, 
          and packed full of flavor. Dip in ranch or your favorite dipping sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon parsley flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 Â½ pounds chicken tenderloins</li>  
            <li>cooking spray</li>          
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, paprika, parsley, seasoned salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Beat egg in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Dredge each chicken tender in seasoned flour. Dip in beaten egg, then back in seasoned flour.</li>
            <li>Coat basket with cooking spray; place as many coated chicken tenders in the air fryer basket 
                as you can without overcrowding. Lightly mist the tops of the tenders with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 8 minutes. Flip chicken over and lightly mist the tops with
                 more cooking spray. Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
                 of chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 8 minutes more. Repeat with any remaining 
                 chicken tenders.</li>
        </ol>
