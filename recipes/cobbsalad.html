    <h2>Cobb Salad Recipe</h2>
        <p>A Cobb salad is an American dish that consists of lettuce topped with 
            bacon, chicken, boiled eggs, tomatoes, and other ingredients arranged 
            in neat rows. It is traditionally served as a main course. The origins 
            of the classic salad is unclear, but many believe it was created in the 
            late 1930s at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 slices bacon</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 head iceberg lettuce, shredded</li>
            <li>3 cups chopped, cooked chicken meat</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 cup blue cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) bottle Ranch-style salad dressing</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place eggs in a saucepan and cover completely with cold water; bring
                 to a boil, then cover and remove from heat. Let eggs sit for 10 to 12
                  minutes, then cool, peel and chop.</li>
            <li>While the eggs are cooking, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook 
                over medium-high heat until evenly brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain, crumble, 
                and set aside.</li>
            <li>Divide shredded lettuce among individual plates. Top with rows of bacon, 
                eggs, chicken, tomatoes, blue cheese, green onions, and avocado.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with dressing.</li>
        </ol>
